## Project Details

### Overview
_This project is a smart agriculture platform that leverages real-time soil data and AI-based analysis to help farmers make informed decisions. It provides features like crop suitability predictions, market insights and cultivation rankings to enhance agricultural productivity. The platform is available as both a web and mobile app, ensuring accessibility and ease of use for farmers across different regions. ðŸŒ¾ðŸš€_

### Problem Statement
_In this technologically advancing world, our farmers of India tend to struggle with inconsistent crop yields due to a huge lack of data on soil conditions and weather patterns. This inefficient selection of crops arise margin for unsustainable agricultural practices along with crop failure risks which affect both productivity and our environment._

### Solution
_Our solution includes IoT-based soil monitoring, AI-driven analysis and real-time weather data to provide the most precise crop recommendations for specific locations with the help of a color-coded map of India indicating the probability of a crop to flourish, which empowers our farmers with actionable insights for sustainable farming. Therefore by reducing the crop failure risks and optimizing water usage, this initiative promises a climate resilient and sustainable agriculture._
